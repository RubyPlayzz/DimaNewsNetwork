        <p>Dima News Network was created in under a week by RubyPlayzz & nisio,</p>
        <p>to practise HTML & CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most stories are based on things we've done in Roblox,</p>
        <p>none of this has happened in real life!</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We're
            <a href="https://github.com/RubyPlayzz/DimaNewsNetwork/" target="_blank">
                open source on github
            </a>
            so do whatever you want with our code!
        </p>
        <p>A tutorial for adding articles is in the <code>README.md</code> file.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We have many updates planned, stay tuned!</p>
