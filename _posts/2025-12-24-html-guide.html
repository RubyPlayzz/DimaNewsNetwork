<p>
    Hey there! Wanna learn coding a website? Don’t want it to take forever to start
    making simple HTML websites? Wanna make coding easy?
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Well than look no further! In this article I am going to teach you HTML from an
    experienced coder (who originally created the html for the article layouts).
    <br>
    <br>
    Most of the code here examples are editable, so you can try messing around and editing them.
</p>

<h1>1. The Basics</h1>

<p>
    So to start this off, we'll learn the basics of HTML.
</p>

<h2>Making an element</h2>

<p>
    To start this off you need to know how to make a basic element like this:
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<p>Reginald is in the floor.</p>"
%}

<p class="secondary" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    Try changing "Reginald is in the floor." to something else.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    You first have to do the opening tag. The text inside corresponds to what type of element it is
    (<code>p</code> for paragraph, in this case.)
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Once you enter the content of your tag, you close the tag by repeating what you did for the opening tag, but adding a backslash (/) before the letter
</p>

<br>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>Elements can also have attributes:</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=false content=
"<p class='note'>Reginald is in the floor.</p>"
%}

<p>
    Attributes can be very useful. They give extra information to an element.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    In this example, the <code>class</code> attribute is added to the element, which is used to identify an element so it can be styled.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some elements require attributes to be visible, for example <code>img</code> elements. You'll learn more about these soon.
</p>


<h1>2. Text</h1>

<p>
    We've already learned how to add a paragraph like this:
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<p>Hi this is a paragraph</p>"
%}

<p>
    But our page would look boring and harder to read if it was all just paragraphs. We can use <code>&lth1&gt</code> tags (short for heading 1). 
    We can also use 
    <code>&lth2&gt</code>, 
    <code>&lth3&gt</code>, 
    <code>&lth4&gt</code>, 
    <code>&lth5&gt</code> and 
    <code>&lth6&gt</code>
     for headings at lower levels.
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<h1>Level 1 heading</h1>
<h2>Level 2 heading</h2>
<h3>Level 3 heading</h3>
<h4>Level 4 heading</h4>
<h5>Level 5 heading</h5>
<h6>Level 6 heading</h6>"
%}

<p>
    Now if you want to add italic, bold or underlined text, you can put these tags 
    in with the text. For italic you use <code>&ltem&gt</code> or <code>&lti&gt</code>, for bold you would use
    <code>&ltstrong&gt</code> or <code>&ltb&gt</code> and to underline your text you can use <code>&ltmark&gt</code> or <code>&ltu&gt</code>, Here’s an
    example
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<p>This is how a <em>emphasised</em> looks like</p>
<p>Here’s what <strong>strong</strong> looks like</p>
<p>And finally here’s <mark>underlined</mark> text</p>
<p><strong><em>Strong and emphasised text!!!</em></strong></p>"
%}


<p>
    You can also use <code>&ltb&gt</code> tags for bold, <code>&lti&gt</code> tags for italic and
    <code>&ltu&gt</code> tags for underlined text.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    However, screenreaders (a tool used by people with visual impairments which read out the webpage)
    recognise <code>&ltem&gt</code>, <code>&ltstrong&gt</code> and <code>&ltmark&gt</code> tags and
    read them out differently.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    For this reason, its better to use those <code>&ltem&gt</code>, <code>&ltstrong&gt</code> and <code>&ltmark&gt</code>,
    unless you are making text look different purely for decoration.
</p>

<p>Next we’ll find out how to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to add &lt and &gt</li>
    <li>How to add code as a text without interfering without your code,</li>
    <li>How to add contact details using html,</li>
    <li>How to add a site from where you referenced a piece of text or quote,</li>
    <li>How to add quotation marks wrapped around text,</li>
    <li>How to add abbreviations,</li>
    <li>How to indicate time on a website,</li>
    <li>How to add subscript and superscript.</li>
</ul>

<p>This might all seem a ton but its nothing too much.</p>

<p>To add &lt&gt you can use &lt; and &gt; (lt – less than,
gt – greater than)</p>

<p>
    For example: &ltp&gt
</p>

<p>
    To do the code tag you do &lt;code&gt;&lt/p&gt
</p>

<p>
    It would look like this on the website – To do a code tag you do &ltcode&gt
</p>

<p>
    To add code as a text on your website you do the &ltcode&gt tag, for example
</p>

<p>
    &lth4&gtFor a paragraph you can do &ltcode&gt&ltp&gtparagraph&lt/p&gt&lt/code&gt like that &lt/h4&gt
</p>

<p>
    Only the &lth4&gt and &ltcode&gt tag get noticed by your website but the &ltp&gt tag stays as
    normal text
</p>

<p>
    To add contact info for example you can use the &ltaddress&gt tag like this
    &ltaddress&gt
    &ltp&gt Name: RubyPlayzz
    Website: dima.news &lt/p&gt
    &lt/address&gt
    You can use this for any contact info you need (e.g. Name, Address, Number, Email
    etc.)
</p>

<p>
    To reference a site you can use the cite attribute, you would usually use this when
    you are taking a quote from a website or you are taking any piece of info/text, for
    example:
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<p>
    Here’s the <a href='https://dima.news/'><cite>Dima News Network</cite></a> news from today     
</p> 
<blockquote cite='https://dima.news/article/Halloween'> 
    <p>Today is halloween here’s what team has done for halloween</p> 
</blockquote>"
%}

<p>This is useful for quoting stuff from websites and giving them credit</p>

<p>To add quotation marks around a quote or text you can use the &ltq&gt tag for example:</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=false content=
"<q>Hope is a thing with feathers, that pearches in the soul</q>"
%}

<p>To add abbreviations you add the &ltabbr&gt tag for example:</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=false content=
"<p>We use <abbr>HTML</abbr> to make websites using coding</p> "
%}

<p>
    You can add time using the &lttime&gt tag, this is useful to indicate time on a website,
    for example:
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=false content=
"<time datetime: 14-10-2025>14 October 2025</time> "
%}

<p>
    Now finally, to add superscript or subscript you can use, &ltsub&gt for subscript and
    &ltsup&gt for superscript, this is useful for writing down dates, chemical formulae and
    mathematical equations, here’s some examples:
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<h1>Water’s Chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O</h1> 
<p>Today’s date is October 14<sup>th</sup> 2025</p> 
<h3>If x<sub>3</sub> is 27, then x is 3</h3>"
%}

<p>
    So now you bassicaly know everything about text let’s move on to the next chapter
</p>

<h1>
    3. Images, Videos and Audio
</h1>

<p>
    So the website still looks pretty boring with only text on it so let’s add an image, to
    add a image you can use the &ltimg&gt tag, the &ltimg&gt tag is a void element (it dosen’t
    have an ending tag),
</p>

<p>For example if you have a picture called “DNN.png” this is how the code would look:</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<img src=https://example.com/images/DNN.png  
alt='Dima News Network Logo'>"
%}

<p>If your image is in a subdirectory (folder) called “Images” you can do this instead</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<img src=“images/DNN.png  
alt='Dima News Network Logo'>"
%}

<p>
    Now let’s see how you can add a caption to your image, resize your image and give
    it a title.
</p>

<p>
    So if you want to resize your image you just have to use width, and length like this
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<img src=https://example.com/images/DNN.png  
    alt='Dima News Network Logo'
    width='128' 
    length='128'
>"
%}

<p>
    Now to add a caption and a title you have to make your &ltimg&gt a figure by wrapping it
    around the &ltfigure&gt tag and to give your Image a caption you give it a &ltfigcaption&gt
    tag, here’s how all that looks like
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<figure> 
    <img src='images/DNN.png'
        alt='Dima News Network Logo' 
        width='128' 
        length='128' 
        title='DNN Logo'
    > 
    <figcaption>The Dima News Network Logo</figcaption> 
</figure>"
%}

<p>
    Now if you want to add a video you can use the &ltvideo&gt tag and it works almost
    exactly the same as the &ltimg&gt tag, Here’s an example on how the &ltvideo&gt tag looks
    like
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<video src='DNNTrailer.mp4'>"
%}

<p>
    But if you want to add controls then it will look something like this
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<video 
    src='DNNTrailer.mp4'
    controls 
    width='1920' 
    height='1080' 
    autoplay 
    loop 
    muted 
    preload='auto' 
    poster='DNNLogo.png'
>"
%}

<p>Here’s what all these controls mean</p>

<p>Width and Length just set the size of the video</p>

<p>Autoplay plays the video automatically</p>

<p>Loop just make the video loop</p>

<p>Muted just mutes the video</p>

<p>Poster is just a cover image for the video</p>

<p>Preload is used for buffering large files, it has 3 values</p>

<ul>
    <li>“None” does not buffer the file</li>
    <li>“Auto” buffers the file automatically</li>
    <li>“Metadata” buffers only the metadata for the video</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Now to add some subtitles you have to add a .VTT file to your html code, a .VTT file
    looks something like this
</p>

<code>
    WEBVVTT
    1
    00:00:22:230 —&gt 00:00:24.606
    This is the first subtitle
    2
    00:00:30.739 —&gt 00:00:34.074
    This is the second subtitle
</code>

<p>Now to add it to your video you do this</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<video controls> 
    <source 
        src='DNNTrailer.mp3'
        type='video/mp4'
    > 
    <track 
        kind='subtitles' 
        src='subtitles_es.vtt '
        srclang='es' 
        label=“Spanish” 
    /> 
</video> "
%}

<p>
    Now lets add some audio, so to add audio you use the &ltaudio&gt tag where it’s
    basically the same as the &ltvideo&gt except for controls there’s no width and length,
    and theres no poster for example
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<audio controls> 
    <source src='dnnmenu.mp3' type='audio/mp3' /> 
</audio> "
%}

<h1>4. Tables, Links, Forms, Buttons and Lists</h1>

<p>
    So to do a table you use the &lttable&gt, &lttd&gt (Table Data), &lttr&gt (Table Row) and &ltth&gt
    (Table Header) tags, You use &lttable&gt to indicate it’s a table, Use &lttd&gt for putting in
    the data of the table, Use &lttr&gt to make a row and &ltth&gt as a table header, for
    example
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Height</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mark</td>
        <td>21</td>
        <td>6’1”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Max</td>
        <td>23</td>
        <td>6’3”</td>
    </tr>
</table>"
%}

<p>
    That’s how you can make a simple table in html (oh and also don’t use tables as a
    website layout, just don’t, it just makes everything more complicated for accessibility
    and more)
</p>

<p>
    Now to make a link to something we would need to use either the &lta&gt tag, you also
    need to add “href” to the &lta&gt tag to indicate what website your referencing to, for
    example
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<p> 
    Hello this is a link to 
    <a href='https://dima.news/'>Dima News Network</a> 
</p>"
%}

<p>You can also put the links into a heading</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<a href='https://dima.news/'> 
    <h1>Dima News Network</h1> 
</a>"
%}

And also you can put images as a link!

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<a href='https://dima.news/'> 
    <img src='DnnLogo.png' alt='Dima News Network Logo'> 
</a>"
%}

<p>You can also make it so a title of the link appears when you hover with the mouse</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<p> 
    Here’s a link to the 
    <a href='https://dima.news/'
    title='Dima News Network'>DNN Website</a> 
</p>"
%}

<p>
    Additionally you can use the &lta&gt tag to link it to a document
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<a href='projects/index.html'>This links to a file</a>"
%}

<p>Now to make a button you just use the &ltbutton&gt tag like this</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<button>This is a button</button>"
%}

There’s also different button types

<p>
    &ltbutton type=“submit”&gt - It makes the button a submit button for forms (We’ll learn
forms later on) but you usually don’t need to declare this unless you have different
buttons in your form
</p>

<p>
    &ltbutton type=“reset”&gt - It makes the button a reset all button for forms, don’t use the
reset button unless needed because users that fill out these forms typically don’t like
the reset button because if they fill out a long form and mistake the submit button for
the reset button, it would just be annoying, so just don’t use it.
</p>

<p>
    &ltbutton type=“button”&gt - It makes a button, a button outside the &ltform&gt elements,
     you need to apply JavaScript to make the button do something, but you’ll
    learn JavaScript later on while you’re learning the basics of web coding
</p>

<p>Now moving on to lists,</p>

<p>
    Making a list of items isn’t too difficult, here’s how you do it. There is 2 different type
    of lists you can use, an unordered list and an ordered lists, for unordered lists you
    would use the &ltul&gt tag and for ordered lists you would use the &ltol&gt tag.
</p>

<p>
    Now what is the difference between Unordered lists and ordered list? Well, an
    ordered list is which an order of the items does matter (e.g. Road Directions)
</p>

<p>
    An unordered list is a list where the order of the items doesn’t matter (e.g. Grocery
    List)
</p>

<p> 
    To add a list item you would use the &ltli&gt tag (List Item), here’s an example of a list:
    &ltul&gt
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<ul> 
    <li>Item 1</li> 
    <li>Item 2</li> 
    <li>Item 3</li> 
</ul> "
%}

<p>
    You can also nest in a ordered list in, here’s what that would look like:
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
    </ol>
</ul>"
%}

<p>
    In lists you can add descriptions to your lists (e.g. making a dictionary with terms), to
    add a descriptive list you can use the &ltdl&gt tag, to add a description term you add the
    &ltdt&gt and to add a description definition you add the &ltdd&gt tag, here’s an example
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<dl>
    <dt>News</dt>
    <dd>Newley received or noteworthy information, especially about recent
        events</dd>
    <dt>Network</dt>
    <dd>A group or system of interconnected people or things</dd>
</dl>"
%}

<p>Now it’s time for the final section you’re going to learn in this guide,</p>
<p>The forms!</p>

<p>
    So to make a form you need the &ltform&gt tag and also the &ltinput&gt tag, here’s most of
    the stuff you’ll need to know about inputs
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=false content=
"<input type='text' name='name' id='name' required/> "
%}

<ul>
    <li>type=“text” – It makes the input type, a basic text field</li>
    <li>name=“name” – Specifies a name for the data item. When the form is submitted, the data is sent in name/value pairs.</li>
    <li>id=“name” – Specifies an ID to identify the element. It is usually used to associate it form controls with the &ltlabel&gt</li>#
    <li>required – Makes the input required</li>
    <li>For inputs there’s a few input types like, Radio (Circular Button), Colour (Colour Picker) and more</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Here’s a quick example on how forms look like:
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<form>
    <h2>Subscribe to our newsletter</h2>

    <label for='name'>Name (required):</label>
    <input type='text' name='name' id='name' required />

    <label for='email'>Email (required):</label>
    <input type='email' name='email' id='email' required />
</form>
<button>Sign me up!</button>"
%}

<p>
    As you can see, you can use labels and input tags together like that, let me explain it
    a bit easier
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=false content=
"<label for='Name'>Name (Required):</label> "
%}

<p>
    This is a &ltlabel&gt tag and its basically just the text/label above the input type
</p>

<p>
    In the &ltlabel&gt tag you can see for=“Name” and this is the ID you could set in the
</p>

<p>
    &ltinput&gt type that connects them both together
</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=false content=
"<input type='text' name='name' id='name' required /> "
%}

<p>
    This is the input field you see bellow the text/label, type=“text” just means that you
    can enter text, name=“name” just sets a name for the input, ID=“name” is the ID of
    the input where it connects up to the &ltlabel&gt tag and required /&gt just means that the
    input is required and then it closes off the tag to finish the input tag
</p>

<p>Now here’s a more longer form</p>

{% include codeblock.html lang="html" lang-name="HTML" preview=true content=
"<form action='./payment_page' method='get'>
    <h2>Register for premium</h2>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Choose the plan:</legend>
        <div>
            <input type='radio' id='PremiumChoice1' name='premium' value='Standard' checked />
            <label for='PremiumChoice1'>Standard ($1.99)</label>
            <input type='radio' id='PremiumChoice2' name='premium' value='Professional' />
            <label for='PremiunmChoice2'>Professional ($4.99)</label>
            <input type='radio' id='PremiumChoice3' name='hotel' value='max' disabled />
            <label for='PremiumChoice3'>Max ($9.99)</label>
        </div>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Choose extra add-ons</legend>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='storage' name='extrastorage' />
            <label for='storage'>100GB Extra storage (+$5)</label>
            <input type='checkbox' id='files' name='extrafiles' />
            <label for='files'>50 Additonal max file limits (+$3)</label>
            <input type='checkbox' id=“customization' name='morecuztomizing' />
            <label for='customization'>Extra customization options (+$1)</label>
        </div>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
        <label for='paymentmethod'>Choose your payment method</label>
        <select name='payment' id='paymentmethod'>
            <option value=''>--Please choose an option--</option>
            <option value='card'>Card</option>
            <option value='giftcard'>Gift Card</option>
            <option value='cash'>Cash (In-store)</option>
        </select>
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for='comments'>Any other comments:</label>
        <textarea id='comments' name='comments' rows='5' cols='33'></textarea>
    </p>
</form>"
%}

<h1>5. The end</h1>
<p>
    Now you should know basically everything about HTML, this wasn’t a fully detailed
    explanation guide so I recommend you take a look at the MDN web docs basic html
    course
</p>

<p>Enjoy coding!</p>
