<h1>How it all started</h1>
<p>One time Bloxbunig and RubyGamer64YT (aka RubyPlayz64 — a popular youtuber with 117K Subscribers) wanted to play a normal game of ink game but this game... was diffrent. <br><br>
   So player #064 (aka RubyGamer64YT) and player #456 (aka Bloxbunig) went into the circle with other players and so they began the games.<br><br>
   They first loaded into the game and began to play their first game, Red light Green light. Then they did dalgona where RubyGamer64YT got a circle cookie and Bloxbunig got the star cookie with a lighter which made it really easy for him to beat it, and for RubyGamer64YT it was also easy since it was a circle cookie.
    <br><br>
    After those games the lights turned off and people got empty bottles that you can refill and got forks, Player #456 and Player #064 went on the top bunk bed together and stragetized the game, they both would vote X to play hide and seek and after the other games they were planning to rebel, little does RubyGamer64YT know but one misspell could change this game.<br><br>
After the lights turned on the voted for hide and seek and it actually won, they then continued to play, Bloxbunig (#456) got seeker and RubyGamer64YT (#064) got hider, RubyGamer64YT and Bloxbunig had a promise where they wouldn't kill eachother and just play the game, only in emegency situations. RubyGamer64YT could kill Bloxbunig since he had robux to revive after so it was fine. Blobunig luckly got a kill to survive and RubyGamer64YT found a really solid room to hide in which made him survive to the game.

 The next game was jump rope which was easy for Bloxbunig (#456) but for RubyGamer64YT it wasn't, so Bloxbunig carried RubyGamer64YT on his back and they both made it gladly. Next and last game until the incident was glass bridge, Bloxbunig (#456) and RubyGamer64YT (#064) made it through preety easily. <br><br>

<h1>The "Reginald" Incident</h1>
<p>
    After glass bridge Bloxbunig (#456) told RubyGamer64YT (#064) that they should rebel so RubyGamer64YT agreed and said in chat "tebel" because he misspelled it but he dosen't know that this would change the game.<br><br>
After that they rebbeled but then Bloxbunig wanted to misspell it for fun to so he said "Reginaldbellington" for fun but then RubyGamer64YT told Bloxbunig that they were adding a new person in the game... named "REGINALD"<br><br>
  His real name is mr. peabert but after the rebel they went to the lobby and there he was, standing behind the afk spot, he was there, and reginald gave everyone 3 power rolls because of the new update and thanking players by bringing reginald in and giving everyone 3 power rolls<br><br>
