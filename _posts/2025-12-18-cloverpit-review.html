    Recently I bought a game on Steam called
    CloverPit for €9.99 (was €8.99 when I bought it because of a 10% off sale) and
    I have about 20 hours of playtime on it. Here’s my review and tips on the game.

<h1>What is CloverPit?</h1>

<p>
    CloverPit is a rouge-like game where you
    pay off your never-ending debt by gambling. In the game you spawn in a
    room/tower with an ATM machine to pay off your debt, A phone, A shop on top of
    some drawers, A computer and A roulette machine. Beneath you is a cage that
    opens into a void with some pipes, if you don’t pay off your debt in time, then
    you’ll be dropped into that void and have your run restarted. In the room
    you’ll also see a big metal door that you can open with a key, the key is
    locked in a glass container with wires connecting to the ATM. You unlock this
    key randomly throughout your run.

<p>
    In CloverPit you have
    to pay off your never-ending debt using coins. You start of with 13 coins
    for the roulette and 3 clover tickets. You get 2 options on the roulette, 7
    spins (+1 Clover Ticket) and 3 spins (+2 Clover Tickets). Clover Tickets allow
    you to buy lucky charms to get more luck on spins. You can get coins from 2
    different ways, getting interest from the ATM Machine and get coins from
    gambling on the roulette.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    In the shop you can buy luck charms that
    can give you more (or less) luck on a spin on the roulette. Luck charms usually
    boost the symbols appearance which can make one symbol appear more often,
    symbol reward which can give you more coins for getting a symbol, symbol
    multiplier which multiplies the amount of coins each symbol gives, pattern
    multiplier which gives you a bigger multiplier when you get a specific pattern
    and spin luck which gives you guaranteed symbols for the spin (e.g. If I got a
    luck charm with +7 luck, it gives me 7 guaranteed of the same symbol). There’s
    also charms that give a symbol a trait (e.g. The tumbler gives a clover ticket
    trait to the clover symbol with a +5% appearance rate). Luck charms can also
    have traits. You can notice if a charm has a trait if they have a gradient
    colour on them. Some examples of some traits are, Avid (+2 symbol multiplier),
    Gambler (+2 Clover Tickets at the end of each deadline) etc. There’re 5
    rarities of luck charms you can get. There are Common, Uncommon, Rare,
    Legendary and Sacred Charms. Sacred charms are the rarest one that you can only
    obtain from an angel call on the phone.

    Phone calls can give you different
    advantages like, manifest +1 symbol (Gives more chance for a symbol to appear),
    Double the value of a symbol, Halve the chance of a symbol to appear and more.

<h1>Game Tips</h1>

<p>
    When you first get the game, I recommend
    you unlock all 4 of your drawers. You unlock the drawers by unlocking the key
    that’s connected to the atm. When you get all the drawers, put 4 luck charms in
    them and restart the run. When you restart the run and check the drawer, you’ll
    see an item called “corpse” that gives you +5% debt. When you get it don’t
    equip it yet. In the shop try and find a skull, when you do buy the skull and
    equip all 4 of the corpses that are in the drawers. This gives you a +25% debt
    but after every deadline you get 4 free charms in your drawer. You should try
    and get a decent amount of luck charms in the shop for the first few rounds
    because you can reach your deadline easier. Some charms in the game are locked
    and have a requirement to unlock them. To see all the charms and how to unlock
    them, click on the computer near the shop to the right and list through the
    charms. I recommend you try and unlock all/most of the charms because some of
    them can give you more luck than others.

<p>
    In the game after the 3<sup>rd</sup> deadline,
    you have a 1.5% of getting a 666 that makes you lose all the money you’ve
    earned in that spin and then later if you get a 666 you lose all your money
    that you have. There are 3 types of phone calls in the game, Normal phone
    calls, Devil phone calls and Angel Phone calls. You can get an Angel phone call
    by ignoring 3 devil phone calls. To get a devil phone call you need to get at
    least 1 666 in a deadline. There’s a luck charm called “Devils phone” where
    whenever you click the red button on the roulette you can activate a 666. I
    recommend you use it at the very first round because you won’t lose any money.
    When you ignore 3 phone calls you get an angel phone call (You still need a 666
    in a round to get it) and when you do, every time you get a 666 it gets changed
    into a 999 and doubles your money. When you get to 999 try and get charms that
    boost the chances of 666 appearing since all 666 get turned into 999 so you get
    more chances of getting double your money.

<h1>My Review</h1>

<p>
    And now finally for my review of CloverPit.
    I personally really like this because of the gameplay, visuals and animations.
    The animations on the roulette look very cool and the visuals remind me of PS2
    games. The gameplay is also fun because you progress by buying and combining
    different charms and having some strategy to the game. I would recommend this
    game to people who like other rouge-like games and people who like gambling (Of
    course). But in all seriousness, this a very fun indie game that I personally
    really liked.
