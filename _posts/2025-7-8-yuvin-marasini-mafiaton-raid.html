<h1>First Raid</h1>
<p>The first crime that led to a raid on Yuvin
    Marasini’s Mafiaton occurred during a segment on his inbuilt America’s Got Talent stage, located inside
    the
    mansion itself.<br><br>
    The performance was hosted by three celebrity judges: Kendy D, Big Nas Y, and RubyPlayz64 — a
    popular
    YouTuber with over 118K subscribers.<br><br>
    According to reviewed security footage, the hosts can be seen asking Yuvin a series of questions.
    <br><br>
    After repeated retakes and growing tension, Yuvin reportedly pulled out a weapon and begin firing at the
    judges’ table, attempting to shoot the judges.<br><br>
    Moments later, the Rising City Police stormed the Mafiaton and arrested all four individuals.
    <br><br>Yuvin
    was charged with triple attempted game-ending, while Kendy D, Big Nas Y, and RubyPlayz64 were also
    detained for allegedly resisting arrest and retaliating against police with weapons.

<h1>Second Raid</h1>
<p>
    The second raid occurred after all the judges were bailed out.<br><br> Once again, it took place on the
    inbuilt America’s Got Talent stage inside Yuvin’s Mafiaton mansion.<br><br> The same three celebrities —
    Kendy D, Big Nas Y, and RubyPlayz64 — were present. This time, however, the judges allegedly used
    an
    unauthorized teleportation device to confine Yuvin in a room with tinted, blocked-off windows,
    containing
    only a dance pad and a PC.<br><br>

    During the subsequent police raid, only Big Nas Y was arrested in a bedroom of the Mafiaton. Meanwhile,
    Kendy D and RubyPlayz64 reportedly attempted to game-end a police officer; Ruby allegedly forgot his weapons
    and
    instead stole the officer’s pistol after Kendy carried out the attack.<br><br> Two additional
    officers
    arrived as backup, and although Kendy and Ruby attempted to resist arrest, they were ultimately
    apprehended.<br><br>Yuvin was also arrested for possessing the unknown teleportation device, which has
    since
    been seized by authorities.

<h1>Third Raid</h1>
<p>
    The third raid occurred after the judges had escaped.<br>While in the yard, Big Nas Y jumped on a
    trampoline
    and reached the police helicopter perched atop the building.<br> He then hijacked the helicopter, picked
    up
    the judges, and escaped.<br><br>

    Following their escape, the group fortified their bank vault and proceeded to rob a museum and a jewelry
    store, netting approximately $10,500 each.<br> Upon their return, the police were alerted and swiftly
    raided
    the Mafiaton while the crew was relaxing.<br><br>

    Unbeknownst to the officers, the group had strategically placed four automated turrets near the
    entrance,
    along with two explosive barrels.<br> When the police entered, the turrets fired and the barrels
    detonated,
    injuring several officers. <br>Tragically, one police officer got sent back to the lobby from an explosion caused by a TNT
    barrel
    set by RubyPlayz64.<br><br>

    Despite their efforts to avoid arrest, all members of the crew were apprehended near the inbuilt
    America’s
    Got Talent stage inside Yuvin’s Mafiaton.<br>The stolen money has yet to be recovered, and authorities
    have
    temporarily suspended the investigation into the missing funds.
</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    The crew is now facing up to 15 years in prison following the series of criminal incidents. <br>Yuvin’s
    Mafiaton mansion has been temporarily suspended from his possession due to its involvement in these
    events.<br><br>

    In total, the Mafiaton has been raided three times:<br><br>

    The first raid — a stage shooting incident.<br>
    The second — Yuvin’s suspicious disappearance linked to unauthorized technology.<br>
    The third — an organized robbery of a museum and jewelry store, resulting in a total haul of
    approximately $10,500.
