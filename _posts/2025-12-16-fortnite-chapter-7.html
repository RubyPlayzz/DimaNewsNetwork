<p>So now that Chapter 6 Mini-Season 2 ended (Simpsons Season), we have chapter 7 in Fortnite and it has a lot to unpack.</p>

<h1>Zero Hour</h1>

<p>
    So before Chapter 7 happened we had a live event called &ldquo;Zero Hour&rdquo;. In zero hour before it started you
    where put in a room where you could see 2 characters working on something interesting. There was also a big window
    where you could see homer sleeping in the middle of the simpsons map. There was also a button near the window where
    you had an option to wake up homer. It didn&rsquo;t really do much though.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    When the event timer hit zero everyone was teleported to random events (e.g. Miku concert)
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Then you were teleported to a Island where you had to fight off a big monster. You were by yourself and you had to go
    closer to him and shoot him. You were then found by a helicopter and you were picked up, You could then try and
    shoot the monster with your guns and in the end you could see Godzilla destroy the monster where then we end up
    saving the island and then the whole island becomes green and fixed.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    After that we saw a small trailer where we saw the new skins in the battle pass, the new weapons, a person driving a
    reboot van and more!
</p>

<br>
<p>
    After that you could see someone shooting the battle bus and then it crashes down. Then there is some text on the
    screen showing Chapter 6, then it transitions to chapter 7.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    When that finished you were shown a screen with a view at the island and a 8 hour timer. You had a option to watch
    again or close. If you picked close your game would shutdown and then you had to wait 8 hours until Chapter 7

<h1>What's New</h1>

<p>
    So when Chapter 7 finally started you were given a free skin called &ldquo;Yuki&rdquo;. In the lobby you could see
    that blitz and ranked battle royale were locked with a 3 day timer. You were still able to play normal zero build
    and battle royale.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    In Battle Royale you start the game riding a surfboard since the battle bus crashed. You can still press the button
    that you originally used to thank the bus driver, to pay respects to him.

<br>
<p>
    There is a 20 second timer until hangtime where you get launched up into the air and then you can land on the new
    island for chapter 7.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    The UI for Fortnite is renewed and it looks very cool. In the weapon inventory you can now see the name of them and
    then their rarity with a coloured line at the side of it (Indicating the rarity). The player count and more is now
    moved to the side of the mini map.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    There&rsquo;s a new building system in Fortnite where one of the bumpers on your controller (Or whatever button you
    would usually use on keyboard) would be a wall but then the other button would be a cone, floor or a stair (slope)
    depending on where you look.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    In Chapter 7 we are introduced to new weapons like Holo rush SMG, Vengeful Sniper and Iron Pump Shotgun There is also
    portals randomly placed around the map where if you where to enter one, then you would be met by a few people and
    given a legendary rarity sword. If you fight them of you get a reward. Also around the map you will see a blue alien
    called bill and if you started shooting him or if he sees you he will attack you. If you defeat him you&rsquo;ll get
    some good loot but you&rsquo;ll also see an item drop where if you picked that item up, you would become bill. The
    ability takes up a slot in your inventory but gives you Low gravity and +25 shield and health, so you get 125 health
    and 125 shield.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>
    Overall before the chapter started we got a live event where there was a quick rewind of events then you were put on
    an island and you could fight of a monster, then Godzilla destroyed it and we got a trailer of Chapter 7 and then
    you were put on a screen with a 8 hour timer to wait for chapter 7 or close the game. The chapter introduced new UI,
    new weapons, new map and you were given a free skin. You could also fight a blue alien and become him to get 125
    shields and health with low gravity.
