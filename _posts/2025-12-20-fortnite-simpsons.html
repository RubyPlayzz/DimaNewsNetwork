    Before Chapter 7 Season 1 in Fortnite we had Chapter 6 Season MS2 (AKA The Simpsons Season). In this article
    I&rsquo;ll be discussing what they added in The Simpsons Season.
</p>

<h1>Simpsons Season. What's new?</h1>

<p>
    There was a lot added in the Simpsons season so lets take a look at everything they added. First of all they added a
    new battlepass with 10 new skins you can get which are Marge Simpson, Witch Marge, Ned Flanders, Stupid Sexy Ned
    Flanders, Homer Simpson, Evil Homer, Springfileder Peely, Professor Frink. There was also a ton of extra items in
    the battlepass like back blings, pickaxes, and super level skins. The super level skins were added a slimy radiation
    look to all of the skins you got from the battlepass. You had to unlock each one with 2 level ups. In the Shop they
    had released a Bart Skin and a Lisa skin as well with a bundle. Also at the end of the season they released homer
    with tidy whites as a skin you could buy.

<p>
    In Battle royale we got a new map for the Simpsons season and a new intro to the game. The intro played every time
    you started a new game. It looked like the original opening to the Simpsons but just in game. The new map looked
    very good and similar the actual Simpsons map. They had places like Springfield Town and more, but they did a good
    job at recreating the Simpsons in Fortnite.

<p>
    During Chapter 7 Season MS2 (Mini Season 2) they had a stranger things collab because of the new season stranger
    things had. They added new skins in the item shop like demogorgon, Dustin and more. In Fortnite Blitz they had a new
    map for the Stranger things collab. One side of it was more of a dark map and the other side was brighter and more
    had more buildings. In the current Fortnite (by the time of writing this its Chapter 7 Season 1) you are still able
    to play the Fortnite blitz stranger things map as well as the Playboy Carti Collab in Fortnite. All the maps change
    every 7-8 minutes so go check out the stranger things map! (If it&rsquo;s not that map, just wait a bit. The maps
    change often as I said).

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    That is basically everything that happened in Chapter 6 Season MS2. We got New Maps, New Skins and a new collab. In
    my opinion this was a very fun season and I liked it. I especially liked the Battle Royale map, just from how good
    it was recreated from the real Simpsons.
