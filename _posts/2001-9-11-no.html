    On July 15, 2025, RubyPlayz64 and BloxBunig were just driving around robing places and stuff like everyone else, but
    after BloxBunig's idea, his game was never the same again.

<h1>How it all started</h1>
<p>So Bloxbunig showed RubyPlayz64 his rare limited car called the molten M12.<br><br>
    After that he had an idea to go to the trading island and trade it for a better car.<br><br>
    <br><br>
    After that BloxBunig and RubyPlayz64 went to the trading island together and traded his molten M12 for a Burlee but
    little did they know that it was a cursed car that the mysterious player has tryed to get rid of it for
    years.<br><br>
    Of course at the time they didn't know that it was cursed so they drove it around and had fun with it.

<h1>What happened next</h1>
<p>
    After that trade RubyPlayz64 and Bloxbunig just drove around the new brulee they got, they were going 100, 200, 300
    mph and they were zooming across the map.<br><br> But then Bloxbunig realised that his game was acting weird and
    that whenever he exited the car, he would be invisible for a few seconds and then go back to normal<br><br> He also
    noticed how weirdly his game lagged and it was really hard for him to do anything<br><br>
    So he told RubyPlayz64 that he will shut down his PS5 and rejoin the game so that hopefully it will fix the
    bug.<br><br>
    But unfortunately it wasn't just a bug, it is something way worse.<br><br>
    When he tried to rejoin the game, he was stuck on a loading screen and he couldn't do anything.<br><br>
    He tried to restart roblox and it still didn't work.

<h1>Aftermath</h1>
<p>
    So after all that his game finally loaded in and he decided not to use the brulee, and instead he used the camaro
    which is a free/default car<br><br>
    After that surprisingly his game stoped lagging and the brulle virus was officaly beaten<br><br>
    Bloxbunig can now finally play Jailbreak like he did before and drive his brulee around as much as he wants because
    now the virus has been cured<br><br>
    So now he has told the jailbreak developers about the incident, and they have resolved the issue, but who knows
    maybe it will happen again but for now it has been cured<br><br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    Bloxbunig traded his Molten M12 for a cursed brulee.<br>He didn't know it at first but then the bugatti virus
    started infecting his game<br><br>
    His game started bugging, lagging and not loading<br><br>
    Not even restarting his PS5 worked<br>
    But gladly he was able to cure the virus by driving a diffrent car and now he can play jailbreak like he did
    before<br><br>
