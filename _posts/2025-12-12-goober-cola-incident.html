<p>
    In the game Exploding cola (Made by VexorgIRL) there was a cola in the game behind
    the wall barriers that was called goober cola that was never supposed to be in
    the game.
</p>


<br/>

<p>
    One day in 2024, RubyPlayz64 was playing Exploding colas as usual, trying to find bugs,
    glitches or just playing the game for fun. RubyPlayz64 has 2 colas in the game
    which are called RubyGamer64 cola and the
    RubyPlayz64 cola.
</p>

<p>

    <br>
    The colas give you a speed boost, RubyPlayz64 cola giving you
    a <strong>+10 speed boost</strong> and the RubyGamer64 cola giving
    you a <strong>+70 speed boost</strong>, also they are stackable.

<br>
<p>
    RubyPlayz64 has a history of finding bugs in the game, he even has a golden frame in the
    wall of bug finders. So RubyPlayz64 tried to stack a lot of the RubyGamer64
    colas to see how fast he would be, of course he became extremely fast and he
    then found out that it is possible to get outside of the map by bumping into a
    small object (e.g An NPC, Cola Machine, signs etc.) with crazy speed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now since
    he was outside of the map, he wanted to explore the forest (For context: Behind
    the cobble wall in the map, you can see a small pine forest). 
</p>

<p>
    When he was exploring the forest in the distance he found a white cola machine, he could
    not see what player was near the machine and what it was
    called. He went up closer and found out what the cola was, it was called the
    goober cola.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    The goober colas price was 1a but there wasn’t a different currency in exploding
    colas called “a” and as you can see, there is a nerd photo weirdly placed in
    the middle of the cost sign. It also had a player called Roban standing next to
    the cola, but roban was only ever seen in the ball
    pit, he would pop out of the ball pit a few times then go back down.
</p>

<br/>

<p>RubyPlayz64 was very confused on what this was so he texted the creator of the game
    (VexorgIRL). 
    Vex texted back Ruby saying that there wasn’t such cola as that,
    he even checked the game files and he didn’t find any specific assets for
    goober cola. This was very strange, so theres a strange cola machine standing
    outside the map that has unknown currency and can’t be found in the game files.
    <br>
    <br>
    Ruby decided to take a closer look at it with the creator, he loaded back in
    with Vex and they both glitched out of the map using the stacked RubyGamer64
    cola and found the goober cola. Vex said that this is strange, he also said
    this looks similar to the placeholder machine he had in the game, it had the
    same colour and also had a person next to it which was roban because he just
    decided to put him as a placeholder player.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    Ruby took a close look at it and found that it looks glitched like this isn’t
    supposed to happen. He asked vex if he could take a look at the placeholder
    machine to see if its it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    They then found out that some glitch happened in the
    game and made it so the cola had a random currency (So 1a was just random
    inputs) and the nerd photo was just bellow the map because Vex was testing out
    with image decals, and that was accidentally on the machine because in the
    glitch the x, y and z axis in the game got slightly messed up.
</p>

<p>
    In the end Vex just removed the placeholder machine and just remade it so the goober cola would be there.
    Who knows maybe we’ll see a goober cola comeback,
    or maybe just a roban cola
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    The end ... for now
