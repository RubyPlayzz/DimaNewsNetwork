<p>
  This morning, resident of Rising City "Munny" has been
  officially delclared missing by the Jailbreak Police Force.
</p>

<h1>Who was Munny?</h1>
<p>
  Munny was a resident of the Jailbreak Rising City and a member of
  the police force. She had many friends and was a well respected member
  of the community.

<p>
  Munny was met by RubyPlayz64 along with his team (VexorgIRL & BloxBunig) while they were
  recording a video.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  VexorgIRL and BloxBunig were recording a video together where they would
  say "We are not horses, we are humans, and humans are ..."
  before proceeding to jump off of the tallest tower in Rising City after 
  saying. Witnesses say this was to pay respects to their friend Seong Gi-hun 
  who had sacrificed his life after saying the same thing.

<p>
  Munny, being a member of the Jailbreak police force, courageously 
  climbed the tall building they were recording on as they were illegally
  there and could have been badly injured if the stunt went wrong.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  After they explained what they were doing, Munny was understanding but
  still told them they would have to stop or be detained.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  While VexorgIRL and RubyPlayz64 were understanding, BloxBunig was outraged
  that Munny was stopping them from paying respects to their friend.
</p>

<p>
  He got the group & Munny to enter their helicopter, before ejecting Munny
  from her seat while they were flying directly above a dormant volcano.

<p>
  While Munny survived the incident, she was left with many severe
  burns.
</p>
<p>
  When the team (including BloxBunig) apologised, Munny accepted their 
  apology, showing her respect to the team and forgiveness.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  After the incident, Munny and the team became great friends and assisted
  each other with their jobs, Munny helping with content creation and the 
  team helping her with her policing duties.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  Unfortunately, the story doesn't have a happy ending as Munny cut ties
  with RubyPlayz64, BloxBunig and VexorgIRL after their serious criminal
  activities and charges, including the 
  <a href="https://dima.news/articles/yuvin-marasini-mafiaton-raid/" target="_blank">
    raid of Yuvin Marasini's Mafiaton.
  </a>
</p>

<h1>Where is she?</h1>
<p>
  As of now Munny's whereabouts are unknown.
</p>
<p>However, there are many theories on what happened to her.</p>
<br>

<p>
  Images have been resurfacing of Munny seen at Yuvin Marasini's Mafiaton.
  As she was a member of the Jailbreak Police force, it is possible that
  Munny was the whistleblower that eventually lead to it's raid and arrest
  of Yuvin.

<br>
<p>
  While police are still investigating, it is possible that Munny's was
  kidnapped by connections of Kendy D, Big Nas Y, and RubyPlayz64.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  A noteable fact about Munny's disappearance is that, while she cut ties
  with VexorgIRL and BloxBunig, she remained a connection of RubyPlayz64
  for many months after.
  Many are speculating that Munny did this so she could learn more about
  RubyPlayz64 as she knew he how dangerous of a criminal he was compared to
  BloxBunig and VexorgIRL. This act 
  of selflessness by Munny may have also lead to her kidnapping.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  Another theory is that Munny has simply left the Jailbreak Island, 
  however her online profiles still list her as a member of Badimo so it's
  unlikely she did.
