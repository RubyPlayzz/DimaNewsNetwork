    Recently, RubyPlayz64 bought a free trial of realms plus with marketplace pass and revived the old Minecraft realm
    called &ldquo;Lads survival&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p>

<h1>History of Lads survival</h1>

<p>
    Lads survival used to be a realm made by nisio and was played by DamperLamp, DrNoodles and RubyPlayz64.
</p>
<p> 
    Their base was dug into a mountain and had a ground floor and a basement.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    On the ground floor they had a big chest storage area
    and had beds and even a decorated nether portal place. 
</p>

<p>
    On the basement they had apartments for each player, for
    example RubyPlayz64 had a very nice-looking room with purple and blue checkered carpets and he also had a White Minecraft
    cat in his room, her name was mysterycar and she was a white cat.

<p>
    Then also in the basement they had a big furnace
    place to cook food or also burn ores into diamonds, gold etc. They also had an item machine where you put in a few
    diamonds to roll for an item, the item ranged from sticks to emeralds or even more diamonds and all that.

<p>
    On top of the mountain, they had a big animal and crops farm and had a villager trading place.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    In front of the mountain they had a bridge across water with 3 separate places to go, the first one was the tree
    chopping station where it led to a forest with trees and at the station there were chests where you could fill them
    up with wood if anyone else needed it.
</p>

<p>
    Second place was a big house, it used to be a big wood box with nothing in it but then they transformed it into a
    nice house.
</p>

<p>
    And finally, the third one was an inbuilt small house into a mountain that had chests, carpet, armour stands with
    armour and a bed near a big window, the house was small and was only for decoration, but it was nice.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    On this realm they have beaten the ender dragon multiple times and had very impressive achievements, one of them
    being getting everyone in the realm (4 people) netherite armour with armour trims on them and full netherite tools
    (Sword, Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel and A Hoe) with at least more than 2 enchants on the armour and the tools.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Sadly the subscription for the realm ended and it was no longer active.
</p>

<h1>Revival for the realm</h1>

<p>
    Recently RubyPlayz64 has bought the realms subscription and revived the lads survival by calling it &ldquo;Lads
    Survival v2&rdquo;.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    In this realm there is now only 3 players, JackYaBoy, nisio and RubyPlayz64.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    So far they have a 2 story base with a mine at the time of typing this article.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    They have some iron tools, full copper armour and a ton of wood. Also in the realm world they have a texture pack
    called &ldquo;Actions and Stuff&rdquo; and it changes how items in Minecraft look and also changes up how the
    animations look like (e.g. Switching an Item, Idle animation, Mining animation etc.). Maybe soon they&rsquo;ll get
    diamonds and beat the ender dragon.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
    The end.
